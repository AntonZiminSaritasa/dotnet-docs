SSH
===

OpenSSH is a built-in component of Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10.

Use following commands to install OpenSSH server:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\anton> Get-WindowsCapability -Online | ? Name -like 'OpenSSH*'


Name  : OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent
```

```powershell
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
```

Use administrator credentials for connection.


```powershell
PS C:\Users\anton> ssh administrator@server2019.saritasa.local
The authenticity of host 'server2019.saritasa.local (192.168.11.137)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:LjsYblKkKkaidWJBpSuL+PivLoMU0CBD9Nv0lIqznwU.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

```powershell

```

Read [the article](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2017/12/15/using-the-openssh-beta-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update-and-windows-server-1709/) for advanced configuration.

Public Key Authentication
-------------------------

Make sure a line presents in `C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config`.

```
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

You may want to disable a password authentication also.

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Use [ssh-copy-id](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/copy-id) command to publish an SSH key to a server from a Linux machine. The tool is not a part of OpenSSH for Windows.

Alternative way - add an OpenSSH public key from id_rsa to `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\authorized_keys` on remote server using SFTP, PowerShell Remoting or RDP.

```powershell
Add-Content -Encoding utf8 ~\.ssh\authorized_keys 'ssh-rsa ...'
```

PowerShell Core SSH Remoting
----------------------------

PowerShell Core supports WSMan and SSH for remoting.

Configure SSH subsystem on server according to [the article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/core-powershell/SSH-Remoting-in-PowerShell-Core?view=powershell-6).

Use Chocolatey to install PowerShell Core to client:

```powershell
cinst powershell-core -y
```

Alternatively follow the article: [Installing PowerShell Core on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-6)

Run PowerShell 6.0.2 from Start menu or by full path: `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\6.0.2\pwsh.exe`

Connect to server:

```powershell
PS C:\Program Files\PowerShell\6.0.2> Enter-PSSession -HostName server2019.saritasa.local -UserName administrator
```

Linux Support
-------------

You may install PowerShell Core to Linux and connect to Windows servers over SSH. Read [the article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-6) for details.

Interactive Terminal
--------------------

Current version of OpenSSH for Windows (7.7.1) has serious issues with interactivity. Applications like Far Manager, Midnight Commander, Nano do not work correctly.

See [the issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/440).
